## Overview

The **Health Assistant** is a machine learning-based application built using Streamlit. It allows users to predict the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease based on user input. The application uses custom-trained models to provide accurate health predictions

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Input various health metrics to predict the risk of diabetes.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Analyze heart-related parameters to determine the possibility of heart disease.
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**: Evaluate voice features to assess the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation with a sidebar for selecting different prediction models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Pickle (for model serialization)
- Streamlit Option Menu (for navigation)

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 
   git clone (https://github.com/BharathChandu3/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-.git)
